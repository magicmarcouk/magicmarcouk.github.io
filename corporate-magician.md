Whether you are looking to organise a staff fun day, a formal dinner, a corporate meeting, a conference or an exhibition, Marco can fit his magic to your format, and will really give your guests something to talk about.
 
Marco has worked at many corporate events during his career. As a Corporate Magician, Marco often finds himself being hired again and again, year after year for the same annual event. He is so popular that event organisers often book him straight after their event for the following year.
 
With so much experience, Marco can recommend when and how he performs his magic show for your event. He can do a stand up show from 10 minutes to an hour, hop from table to table during dinner, simply mingle with your guests over drinks or in coffee breaks, or deliver any combination of styles that you choose.
 
Hiring Marco as your Corporate Magician is a great way to ensure your event stands out from your competitors. Marco can personalise some of his tricks, for example making your company logo magically appear on a playing card randomly chosen, inspected and signed by a guest. Marco can also custom make a trick using your products.
 
Marco understands the corporate market well and is experienced in making people feel comfortable. His shows are great ice-breakers for those events where guests need to get to know each other. Event organisers have praised Marco for his humour, for his ability to mingle and mix with a crowd and of course for his amazing and truly unbelievable magic shows!
